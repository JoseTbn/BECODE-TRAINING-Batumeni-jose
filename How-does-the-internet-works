# How does the Internet work
## First of all:


The internet is not a fuzzy cloud. The internet is a wire, actually buried in the ground. Computers connected directly to the internet are called "Servers," while the computers you and I use are "clients," because they are not connected directly to the internet, but through an Internet Service Provider. Routers shuttle packets of information across the internet, and transmit e-mail, pictures, and web pages.

### The End 
I'm the lazyest guy you'll never meet when it's about to resume, so CUL8TR Google will give way better info.
